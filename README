A Simple Eucalyptus Monitoring Program

This web application, appropriately named Euca Monitor, provides a web
frontend to commonly performed Eucalyptus administrative tasks. It
currently has the following functionality:

1. add-keypair: Can generate SSH keys and store them for later use with
spawned VMs.

2. run-instances: Can run VMs and spawn terminals for use with them,
provided that the key was also generated via the Euca Monitor.

3. terminate-instances: Can terminate VMs previously spawned.

==================================
INSTALLING EUCA-MONITOR IN FIVE EASY STEPS
==================================

1. Install git

On Ubuntu this looks like:

sudo apt-get install git-core

On other systems see here:

http://git-scm.com/

2. Download Euca Monitor:

git clone git://github.com/shatterednirvana/euca-monitor.git

3. Edit settings.py and look for the following:

STATIC_DOC_ROOT = '/home/cgb/euca-monitor/static'

KEY_PATH = '/home/cgb/euca-monitor/keys'

ROOT_URLCONF = 'monitor.urls'

TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
    "/home/cgb/euca-monitor/templates"
    # Put strings here, like "/home/html/django_templates" or "C:/www/django/templates".
    # Always use forward slashes, even on Windows.
    # Don't forget to use absolute paths, not relative paths.
)

Change STATIC_DOC_ROOT and TEMPLATE_DIRS to point to where you downloaded
Euca Monitor to, and change KEY_PATH to wherever you want Euca Monitor to
store SSH keys for your instances at (make sure this directory exists
and is readable by the user running Euca Monitor!).

The recommendation is to use euca-monitor/keys .

4. Make sure that your EC2 environment variables are set correctly.
Source'ing your eucarc file should be sufficient. To confirm, you can
always do this:

cgb@magna-carta:~/euca-monitor$ echo $EC2_URL
http://{your ec2 url here}:8773/services/Eucalyptus
cgb@magna-carta:~/euca-monitor$ echo $EC2_ACCESS_KEY 
<your access key should be shown here>
cgb@magna-carta:~/euca-monitor$ echo $EC2_SECRET_KEY 
<your secret key should be shown here>

5. Make sure that boto is installed and that Python can see it.
You can test this out by doing:

cgb@magna-carta:~/euca-monitor$ python
Python 2.6.5 (r265:79063, Apr 16 2010, 13:57:41) 
[GCC 4.4.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import boto
>>> 

And if no exception is thrown (like above), then all is good!

==================================
RUNNING EUCA-MONITOR
==================================

Like any other Django app, this will do the trick:

cgb@magna-carta:~$ cd euca-monitor/
cgb@magna-carta:~/euca-monitor$ python manage.py runserver

==================================
EUCA-MONITOR IS TESTED ON
==================================

Expect Euca Monitor to work on Ubuntu Lucid with Python 2.6 and Boto 1.8d.

Outside of this scenario, Euca Monitor's effectiveness is unknown. If you
happen to run Euca Monitor on a different platform (OS/Python version/Boto version),
please send me mail!

==================================
TODO
==================================

Django has some really cool looking form support - need to rewrite this to use it

Would like to test it out on Mac OS X and the newest version of boto.
