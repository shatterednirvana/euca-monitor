A Simple Eucalyptus Monitoring Program

This web application, appropriately named Euca Monitor, provides a web
frontend to commonly performed Eucalyptus administrative tasks. It
currently has the following functionality:

1. Adds keypairs: Can generate SSH keys and store them for later use with
spawned VMs.

2. Runs instances: Can run VMs, provided that the key was also generated 
via the Euca Monitor.

3. Spawns terminals to instances: If running Euca Monitor on your local
box, it can open terminals for you that automatically connect to your
running instances.

4. Terminates instances: Can terminate VMs previously spawned.

=============================================
INSTALLING EUCA-MONITOR IN FOUR EASY STEPS
=============================================

1. Install git, django, and boto

On Ubuntu this looks like:

sudo apt-get install git-core python-boto python-django

On other systems see here:

http://git-scm.com/

Check to see if the python modules were installed correctly:
Make sure that boto and django is installed and that Python can see it.
You can test this out by doing:

$ python
Python 2.6.5 (r265:79063, Apr 16 2010, 13:57:41) 
[GCC 4.4.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import boto
>>> from django.core.management import execute_manager

make sure no exceptions are thrown
  
2. Download Euca Monitor:

git clone git://github.com/shatterednirvana/euca-monitor.git

3. Edit settings.py and look for the following:

HOME = "/home/cgb/"
EUCA_MONITOR = HOME + "/euca-monitor/"

Change HOME to point to where you downloaded Euca Monitor to: in
this example, it sits in /home/cgb/euca-monitor, so HOME is set
to /home/cgb.

4. Make sure that your EC2 environment variables are set correctly.
Source'ing your eucarc file should be sufficient. To confirm, you can
always do this:

cgb@magna-carta:~/euca-monitor$ echo $EC2_URL
http://{your ec2 url here}:8773/services/Eucalyptus
cgb@magna-carta:~/euca-monitor$ echo $EC2_ACCESS_KEY 
<your access key should be shown here>
cgb@magna-carta:~/euca-monitor$ echo $EC2_SECRET_KEY 
<your secret key should be shown here>

=============================================
RUNNING EUCA-MONITOR
=============================================

Like any other Django app, this will do the trick:

cgb@magna-carta:~$ cd euca-monitor/
cgb@magna-carta:~/euca-monitor$ python manage.py runserver

=============================================
EUCA-MONITOR IS TESTED ON
=============================================

Expect Euca Monitor to work on Ubuntu Lucid with Python 2.6 and Boto 1.8d.

Outside of this scenario, Euca Monitor's effectiveness is unknown. If you
happen to run Euca Monitor on a different platform (OS/Python version/Boto version),
please send me mail!

=============================================
TODO
=============================================

Django has some really cool looking form support - need to rewrite this to use it

Better error handling - we don't yet present all caught error messages nicely to the user

Would like to test it out on Mac OS X and the newest version of boto.
